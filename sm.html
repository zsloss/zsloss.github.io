    <h1>My Daughter's Journey Overcoming Selective Mutism</h1>

    <p>My daughter overcame SM fully at about age 8 - up to that point she was gradually improving and there were many steps we had to take to get to that point. Finally, Lucy N helped us get past the last difficult bit (speaking to the teachers/in the classroom!).</p>

    <p>Her SM started at the beginning of pre-school. We had noticed that she was anxious in public places before pre-school, such as when she was 10 months old and going to baby and toddler sessions. She wouldn't move or join in with the activities, and was very stiff. In the home she would sometimes cry if someone sneezed or coughed, and was sensitive to sudden or loud noises.
        The pre-school staff possibly made it a little worse by being unaware of selective mutism, saying things like "we're trying to find your voice". When eating they put a screen around her to try to encourage her to eat because nobody could see her. They tried their best but without awareness and knowledge of the condition it was ineffective.
        We tried changing pre-school in case the new one could help - they couldn't. Right at the start of school (Year R), my daughter couldn't go to the toilet, couldn't eat, couldn't work, couldn't sit down, and couldn't speak (or point, or whisper, or communicate in any way) to teachers or other children. She would also freeze up out of school - e.g. at an airport she couldn't eat a sandwich. At one point (about age 3 or 4) she stopped talking to her grandparents and other family members - she would only talk to us in our house or when nobody else was around).</p>

    <p>We didn't use any medication. Here are some of the things we did:</p>

    <h2>1) Grandparents (my parents)</h2>
    <p>Our first bit of progress was recording voice messages to them, and replying to their own voice messages. This became more frequent, and in the end it felt like a conversation, so it wasn't a big leap to get them to talk on a call, which eventually happened. There was a walkie-talkie app which was very helpful. What worked for us was taking her to their house for a few days. My wife would play games with her on the kitchen table while my mum would "get on with stuff" like cleaning and cooking, pretending that she wasn't paying attention. This was sliding-in. At the end of the week, they were playing a loud and energetic game and she was getting excited and ended up speaking to my parents for the first time in ages. Once she did that, she spoke to them all the time afterwards, including to her Aunts and other family members. We were really happy about that.</p>

    <h2>2) Friends</h2>
    <p>I can't remember exactly when, but I think in Year R or Year 1 we solved it (outside of school). We had lots of playdates. Similar to with grandparents - we started with voice messages, voice calls, video messages, then video calls, and then on playdates we'd try to do sliding-in basically by getting them very excited and getting her to talk near the friend. Eventually the excitement took over and she started talking to her friends. Once she talked to one friend she talked to them all - like with her grandparents. Lucy N tells me this isn't typical though - I think usually the friends/family members have to be done separately.</p>

    <h2>3) School Year R</h2>
    <p>We got the school to allow us to go in to try sliding-in sessions (this was during Covid just after lockdowns so a bit tricky). This would be a few times a week in the morning, in a computer room. We'd play games with her, like Uno or Dobble with the teacher outside or nearby. Eventually the teacher got closer. We made a lot of progress in these sessions, but after a while it felt like a brick wall - the sessions were a bit chaotic and there was no real structure to them. The teachers tried to help but we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't be given a more controlled environment. The SENDCo would take a lot of time to respond to emails (over a month sometimes). My daughter was more relaxed at least, and wouldn't be so frozen in the class, though she still wouldn't work, eat, go to the toilet, or communicate.</p>

    <h2>4) School Year 1</h2>
    <p>The sliding-in sessions happened right outside the classroom, with lots of people walking past - it wasn't really that great a location but it was all we could get. We didn't really make much progress with these but we kept going in to try. The Year 1 TA was actually very good with my daughter, and helped her to eat and do work. Toilet improved as well, as my daughter went with a friend. What the TA did was to sit with her doing her work, and move her arm for her. Then very very gradually each time, do a bit less. Eventually all she had to do was rest her hand on my daughter's arm and my daughter would do it. And then she didn't even need to do that. It was the same with eating - my daughter would hold the fork and the TA would eventually "hold" her less and less. So by the end of Y1 my daughter was doing work and eating on her own, but still not talking.</p>

    <p>We had NHS SLT help, but they couldn't do direct sessions - if they ever came into school it was just to observe. They gave advice, but nothing we couldn't read online on Smira. They did communicate with the school though. We got an EHCP, which was good to get schools to take it more seriously. We paid a private therapist when my daughter was in Year R, who didn't really seem to know what to do, so we stopped that.</p>

    <h2>5) New School! Year 2</h2>
    <p>We moved house to a new area and changed schools. The SENDCo was amazing - she phoned me the day before school started and invited us in to see the school and meet the teacher. My daughter said "I guess I can talk at this school". She spoke quietly in front of her new class teacher and we had high hopes. Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed - she was very upset on her first day, couldn't speak (even to the teacher she spoke in front of before), and couldn't eat. Toilet was ok, thankfully. She settled in after a few days and could do work, but still couldn't eat or speak. The SENDCo was really organised - she held meetings with us and was very well-prepared. The whole school (even the headteacher!) was made aware of the condition (the SENDCo sent round a Lucy N video to the staff) and my wife was allowed to go in at lunchtime to help her to eat, which eventually worked (by eating on her own outside the hall, and then gradually closer, then inside the hall, then near friends, etc). Speaking was the last thing to solve! A new TA joined specifically to work with my daughter (I think the EHCP helped here). She was also really really good. My wife or I would go in for regular sliding-in sessions at the start of school, and the TA would join us. The sessions were more structured and patient.</p>

    <h2>6) Year 3</h2>
    <p>Thankfully the school kept the same TA working with my daughter. NHS SLT was working with the school to structure the sessions, and the SENDCo was making plans and keeping notes. The sliding-in sessions were very productive. They're slow, and you have to stick with them - just stay at the child's pace and don't expect miracles. It started with walkie-talkies in different rooms, counting numbers. Eventually the TA and my daughter would play games with us there, sitting in a different part of the room, talking quietly when it was their "turn". This became a conversation back-to-back (facing away) on a video call, and then without the video call. Eventually, at last, we (the parents) weren't needed any more! The school took over, and added different people to the sliding-in sessions. Various friends and other children, teachers, staff, and even the headteacher sometimes. The headteacher sent a really nice email about how he was so happy to see my daughter and a friend perform one of those "clapping" rhymes with each other in front of him. One time I picked my daughter up from school, and we saw the TA walking past outside of school. They stopped and had a chat, face to face! I'd never seen this before and it showed me how much progress had been happening in school without us there. It just shows that we were really lucky to have a great school to help us.</p>

    <p>The issue was going from those special sessions to the classroom. My daughter still couldn't speak in the classroom setting or freely around the school and it just felt impossible to solve. We might have gotten there eventually, but at this point we got to the front of Lucy N's waiting list and seized the chance. Lucy came to our house and had very specific instructions about how we should prepare and what to do. She built rapport with my daughter very easily, and got everything ready so that she could go into the school. Again, the school was really helpful and just allowed Lucy to have/do anything she needed. We booked 4 half-days of Lucy going in. After school finished, we went in to meet with Lucy and the teacher. The teacher escorted us there and said something like "Lucy is amazing, you've got to see what she's done". On the first day she had gotten my daughter to talk in the corridors, and kept a checklist of all the children in the year. She ticked them off one by one as my daughter spoke to them. On the second day she completed the list(!) and then moved into the classroom gradually. Day 3 was cancelled because of a storm, but she spent longer on Day 4 to compensate. By the end of Day 4 my daughter was speaking in the classroom, playing games and talking to teachers and children. Lucy took my daughter round the school to tell a joke to every member of staff that she could. When we were in the meeting at the end of the day Lucy said "oh, we haven't done the register yet - can we do it?" and the teacher (who was also excellent by the way - a common theme at this school) rushed my daughter back into the classroom with all the kids still there and took an impromptu register. My daughter answered the register in front of everyone. What Lucy managed in about 3 days (and two of them were only half days!) is probably the most impressive thing I've ever witnessed.</p>

    <p>Once Lucy left, she left very clear instructions for how to continue and maintain the progress, which the school followed very well. No regressions happened after that.</p>

    <h2>Year 4 and 5 (she's now in Year 5)</h2>
    <p>Year 4 and 5 have been completely fine with regard to talking and confidence. She also goes to Brownies, Stagecoach Drama and music lessons - these didn't require sliding-in - I think they were fine from the beginning (all since we moved house). There's still the odd occasion where she is frustrated by not being able to sing a line at school when the other children can.</p>

    <p>The school was and is very supportive. Along with the SENDCo, the headteacher, and the TA, all the class teachers in each year have been very sensitive, understanding, and helpful at every stage.</p>

    <h2>Summary & Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Take action, but also be patient - we often felt that it was unsolvable but any progress is good and gives you something to build on.</li>
        <li>Contact the NHS or Confident Children, depending on budget and if the NHS have SLT services in your area.</li>
        <li>Sliding-in sessions - get what you can from the school and hopefully they'll give you what you need. Make sure as many staff at the school are aware.

    <p>Any questions about any of this, please feel free to ask. I remember what it's like and you can feel really helpless and despairing, so I'm very happy to provide any more information or advice you need.</p>
